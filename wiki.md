This is a small tutorial on how to write and run a "Hello World!" program in Python.

## Installing Python.
The first thing to set up before writing our program is to download Python. Depending on your OS, the process is a bit different but the information for installing Python is found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

Once Python is installed, we can start creating the **Hello World** Program!

## Writing the Program!
There are many IDEs(integrated development environment) available to develop python with. Here are some common programs:

- [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

There are many more, but for the simplicity of this tutorial, we will be using notepad or textpad.

### Step 1: Navigating through your cmd line
One of the first thing to learn when trying to work with python is navigating your OS's command line. Depending on the OS, the way to navigate through the command line will be different. But overall, the main functionalities that we will be using is search, change directory, and execute python code.

OS specific command line tutorials:
- [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)
- [Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/)
- [MacOS](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/)

### Step 2: Creating our program
Once you get familiar with using the command line, create a file named "hello_world.py" at the directory that you would like to save the file at. Make sure to be familiar with navigating to the directory in the command line.

We can start by introducing the *print()* method. By specifying text between quotations(""), we are able to "print" text onto the command line when our program runs. Try it out!
```Python
print("Hello World!")
```

Once you save this, we will be able to run the python script!

### Step 3: Running our program.
Now that we have created a program, we will run it in our command line! First, navigate to the directory of the python script. You can make sure that you are in the correct directory by listing the contents of the directory using the command to list the directory on the specific os.

Now, to run the program, we type in:
```Bash
python [filename]
```

Congratulations! You have written and ran the "hello_world.py" program!

A Machine Learning Model in forecasting floats in the Atlantic Ocean as part
of the DARPA's Forecasting Floats in Turbulence challenge in the Autumn of 2021.
The Model was a modified [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
model that took in data from floats provided by [Sofar](https://www.sofarocean.com/)
and GRIB data provided by the [GFS-Wave model](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/viewer.shtml).
